    "Miniconda is a packaged up version of python.  It allows us to manage package management.\n",

    "A typical game has what is called a **Game Loop**.  Every cycle of the game loop is called a **frame**.  The quicker your program can do things in each cycle the faster your game will run.  This loop keeps going on forever until the user exits the game, thats why when you look at a game it's always playing.\n",

    "In a typical game the game loop consists of the following parts\n",
    "+ Process user input also called events\n",
    "+ Update the state of all game objects (movement or collisions)\n",
    "+ Update the display or render the screen\n",
    "+ Maintain the speed of the game or controlling the FPS"

    "\n",
    "WIDTH = 360  # width of our game window\n",
    "HEIGHT = 480 # height of our game window\n",
    "FPS = 30 # frames per second\n",
    "```\n",
    "+ initialize our pygame package and the sound component\n",
    "+ then we create the screen, set the caption and create a clock that will control the FPS\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# initialize pygame and create window\n",
    "pygame.init()\n",
    "pygame.mixer.init()  # for sound\n",
    "screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))\n",
    "pygame.display.set_caption(\"My Game\")\n",
    "clock = pygame.time.Clock()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The next thing we need to do is setup the game loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Game Loop\n",
    "running = True\n",
    "while running:\n",
    "    # Process input (events)\n",
    "    # Update\n",
    "    # Render (draw)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5.1 Render / Draw Section\n",
    "We are going to start with the render section.  At this point in the development we dont have anything to draw but we can setup the color of the screen.  We are going to set the screen to solid black using RGB colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer screens are made up of pixels, and these pixels have 3 parts to them: red, green, and blue. How much each \n",
    "part is lit up determines what color that pixel is, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/rgb_color_explain.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the three primary colors can have a value between 0 (off) and 255 (100% on), so there are 256 \n",
    "different possibilities for each of the three primary colors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of some colors you can make:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/rgb_color_example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand colors, let’s define a few at the top of our program: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Colors (R, G, B)\n",
    "BLACK = (0, 0, 0)\n",
    "WHITE = (255, 255, 255)\n",
    "RED = (255, 0, 0)\n",
    "GREEN = (0, 255, 0)\n",
    "BLUE = (0, 0, 255)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And then we can have our draw section fill the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Draw / render\n",
    "screen.fill(BLACK)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this isn’t quite enough, because of the way computer displays work. Changing a pixel on the screen means telling the video card to tell the monitor to change the actual pixel. In computer terms, this is a very, very slow process. So if you have a lot of things to draw on the screen, it can take a very long time to draw them all. We can fix this in a clever way by using something called double-buffering. This sounds fancy, but it really just means this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we had one of those whiteboards that is 2-sided and can flip over to show one side or the other. The front will be the display (the screen the player sees), while the back is hidden and only the computer can “see” it. Every frame, we do all of our drawing on the back side - every character, every bullet, every sparkly light, etc. Then, when we’re done, we flip the board over and show the new frame. This means that we’re only doing that slow process of talking to the display once every frame, and not for every single thing on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "All this happens automatically in pygame. You just have to tell it to flip that whiteboard when you’ve finished drawing. In fact, the command is even named flip(): \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Draw / render\n",
    "screen.fill(BLACK)\n",
    "# *after* drawing everything, flip the display\n",
    "pygame.display.flip()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Just make sure that you always do flip() last. If you try to draw something after the flip, it won’t be seen!\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5.2 Process Inputs / Events\n",
    "We don’t have a game just yet, so we can’t really say what keys or mouse buttons or other controls we want to listen for. However, there’s one important event that we need to set up. If you tried running the program right now, you’d see that you have a problem: there’s no way to close the window! Clicking on the ‘X’ in the corner doesn’t work. That’s because that’s actually an event, and we need to tell our program to listen for that event and have it exit the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Events can happen any time. What if the player clicks the ‘jump’ button while the update or draw part of the loop is happening? You don’t want to just ignore that input - the player will be frustrated. So what Pygame does is save up all the events that have happened since the last frame. That way if the player is quickly mashing lots of buttons, you can make sure you know about all of them. This will be a list, so we run a for loop to look at all of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for event in pygame.event.get():\n",
    "    # check for closing window\n",
    "    if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\n",
    "        running = False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Pygame has lots of events that it is able to look for. pygame.QUIT is the event that happens when the ‘X’ is clicked, so we set running to False and the game loop will end.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5.3 Controlling the FPS\n",
    "We don’t really have anything to put in the ‘Update’ section yet, but we do still need to make sure we use our FPS setting to control the speed. We can do that like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while running:\n",
    "    # keep loop running at the right speed\n",
    "    clock.tick(FPS)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The tick() command tells pygame to figure out how long the loop took and then pause for however long it takes to make the whole loop (meaning the whole frame) to last the right amount of time. If we set FPS to 30, that means we want a frame to last 1⁄30 or 0.03 seconds. If our loop code (updating, drawing, etc) only takes 0.01 seconds, then pygame will wait for 0.02 seconds, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5.4 Exiting \n",
    "Finally, let’s make sure that when the game loop does end, we actually destroy the game window. We do this by putting pygame.quit() at the very end of our code. "
