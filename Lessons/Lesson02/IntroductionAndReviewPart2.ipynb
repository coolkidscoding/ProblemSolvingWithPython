To be able to process a large amount of data we have to setup a program that will \"loop\" over a large amount of records.  In Python we call this looping, because we loop over each pice of data and do something to it.  In other words we process it."

With the introduction of the loops we know have the ability to do code that is in the loop and code that is out of the loop.  This in general is what is called a **code block**.  In Python, code blocks are identified by indentations.  All the code at the same level of indentation is considered to be in the same code block. "
