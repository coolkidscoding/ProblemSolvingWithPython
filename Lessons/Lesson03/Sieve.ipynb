    "### 1.1 What is a Prime Number?\n",
    "\n",
    "A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, 1 × 5 or 5 × 1, involve 5 itself. However, 6 is composite because it is the product of two numbers (2 × 3) that are both smaller than 6. Primes are central in number theory because of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic: every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime itself or can be factorized as a product of primes that is unique up to their order. \n",

    "That fact makes primes vitally important to communications. Most modern computer cryptography works by using the prime factors of large numbers. The large number that was used to encrypt a file can be publicly known and available, because the encryption works so only the prime factors of that large number can be used to decrypt it again. Though finding those factors is technically only a matter of time, it’s a matter of so much time that we say it cannot be done. **A modern super-computer could chew on a 256-bit factorization problem for longer than the current age of the universe, and still not get the answer**."
