    "\n",
    "Ancient civilizations required fairly accurate computed values to approximate π for practical reasons, including the Egyptians and Babylonians. Around 250 BC the Greek mathematician Archimedes created an algorithm for calculating it. In the 5th century AD Chinese mathematics approximated π to seven digits, while Indian mathematics made a five-digit approximation, both using geometrical techniques.\n",

    "Monte Carlo methods are a class of computational algorithms that rely on random numbers to obtain numerical results. Their essential idea is using randomness to solve problems. They are used in many different types of problems especially in the physical, mathematical and finance problem space. In this lesson we are not going to get into the math behind Monte Carlo methods, all we need to know is that we are going to use a random sample in our solution.  If you recall we have already used random sampling in our probability problem."
