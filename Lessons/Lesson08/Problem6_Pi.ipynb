    "Now that we have the background we need to formulate this solution, how do we actually put together a solution?  Think about this for a second.  If we had a square with side of length 2, and we inscribed a unit circle in that square we would have something like the below figure.  Imagine now if we threw darts that this figure.  What is the probabilty that our dart would land inside the circle versus outside the circle (or in the area between the circle and the square)?  It would be the ration of the area of the circle to the area of the square or roughly 0.7854.  We are going to use this fact to calculate Pi."
