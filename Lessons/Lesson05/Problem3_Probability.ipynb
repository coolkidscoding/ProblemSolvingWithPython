    "### 1.1 What is Probability?\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability is the measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. Probability quantifies as a number between 0 and 1, where, 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty. The higher the probability of an event, the more likely it is that the event will occur. A simple example is the tossing of a fair (unbiased) coin. Since the coin is fair, the two outcomes (\"heads\" and \"tails\") are both equally probable; the probability of \"heads\" equals the probability of \"tails\"; and since no other outcomes are possible, the probability of either \"heads\" or \"tails\" is 1/2 (which could also be written as 0.5 or 50%).\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts have been given a formalization in probability theory, which is used widely in such areas of study as mathematics, statistics, finance, gambling, science (in particular physics), artificial intelligence/machine learning, computer science, game theory, and philosophy to, for example, draw inferences about the expected frequency of events. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many events can't be predicted with total certainty. The best we can say is how likely they are to happen, using the idea of probability.\n",

    "\n",
    "When a coin is tossed, there are two possible outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    heads (H) or\n",
    "    tails (T)\n",

    "Throwing Dice \n",
    "When a single die is thrown, there are six possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n",
